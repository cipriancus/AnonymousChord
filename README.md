#WormNET

P2P network based on the Chord protocol.

Mail goal is the hiding of the users identity by creating random walks in the network.

The overlay use-case is a job search engine for users that want to change jobs securely.

Special thank to :

Laurent Vanni & Nicolas Goles Domic for the implementation of Chord, it helped me save a lot of time by not starting from scratch:
